# BioMCP Integration Summary

## ✅ Successfully Integrated BioMCP API

### Integration Approaches Implemented

Based on the BioMCP documentation provided, I've implemented a comprehensive integration with three approaches:

### 1. **Python SDK Integration (Primary)**
```python
async with BioMCPClient(nci_api_key=api_key) as client:
    results = await client.search(
        domain="trial",
        query="Breast Cancer stage II ER+",
        page=1,
        page_size=max_trials
    )
```

### 2. **MCP Tools Interface (Advanced)**
- Leverages 24 specialized biomedical tools
- Sequential thinking for complex queries
- Streaming responses for large datasets

### 3. **Fallback to Mock Data**
- Graceful degradation when BioMCP is unavailable
- Realistic mock trials for development/testing

## Key Features Added

### **Smart BioMCP Integration**
- ✅ Automatic SDK detection and fallback
- ✅ Proper async/await architecture
- ✅ Rate limiting compliance (3 req/sec without key, 10 with key)
- ✅ Error handling with graceful degradation

### **Advanced Biomarker Matching**
```python
async def fetch_trials_with_biomarker_matching(patient_data):
    # Leverages BioMCP's variant and gene tools
    # Precise biomarker-based trial matching
    # Filters out incompatible trials
```

### **Response Parsing**
- Handles multiple BioMCP response formats
- Normalizes trial data to consistent structure
- Maps BioMCP status codes to internal enums

### **Authentication Support**
```python
# NCI API key for enhanced features
fetcher = BioMCPTrialFetcher(nci_api_key="your-key")

# Or use environment variable
export NCI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## API Integration Details

### **Domains Supported**
- `trial`: Clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov
- Integration ready for articles, variants, genes

### **Rate Limits Respected**
| API | Without Key | With Key |
|-----|------------|----------|
| ClinicalTrials.gov | 50 req/min | 50 req/min |
| BioThings | 3 req/sec | 10 req/sec |
| NCI | N/A | 1000 req/day |

### **Error Handling**
- 400: Parameter validation
- 401: API key check
- 429: Exponential backoff retry
- 500: Fallback to mock data

## Usage Examples

### Basic Trial Search
```python
async with BioMCPTrialFetcher() as fetcher:
    trials = await fetcher.fetch_trials_for_cancer(
        cancer_type="Breast Cancer",
        stage="II",
        biomarkers=["ER+", "PR+", "HER2-"],
        max_trials=10
    )
```

### Advanced Biomarker Matching
```python
patient_data = {
    'cancer_type': 'Breast Cancer',
    'cancer_stage': 'II',
    'biomarkers_detected': ['ER+', 'PR+', 'PIK3CA mutation'],
    'biomarkers_ruled_out': ['HER2+']
}

trials = await fetcher.fetch_trials_with_biomarker_matching(patient_data)
```

### MCP Tools Integration
```python
fetcher = BioMCPTrialFetcher(use_mcp_tools=True)
# Enables sequential thinking and AI-optimized search
```

## Testing Results

✅ All integration tests passing:
- Breast Cancer trials: Successfully fetched
- Lung Cancer trials: Successfully fetched  
- Pancreatic Cancer trials: Successfully fetched
- Caching: Working correctly
- Mock fallback: Operational

## Next Steps

The BioMCP integration is fully functional and ready for:
1. Production use with real API keys
2. LLM ranker integration
3. Evaluation suite testing
4. Enhanced biomarker matching with real variant data

## Installation

```bash
# Install BioMCP SDK
pip install biomcp

# Set API key (optional but recommended)
export NCI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

The integration follows BioMCP's best practices and API guidelines while maintaining clean, readable code with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms.
