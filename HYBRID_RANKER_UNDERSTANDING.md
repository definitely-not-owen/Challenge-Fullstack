# Updated Understanding: Hybrid LLM Ranker Approach

## Key Insights from Expert Consultation

Based on your expert consultation, I now understand we're building a **sophisticated hybrid system** that combines the best of deterministic rules and cutting-edge LLM capabilities. This is a significant upgrade from the original pure-LLM approach.

## üéØ Core Philosophy: "Filter First, Then Rank Smart"

### Why Hybrid?
1. **Safety**: Deterministic filters prevent obvious mismatches
2. **Efficiency**: Reduce LLM costs by pre-filtering
3. **Transparency**: Clear audit trail of decisions
4. **Quality**: Latest models + mixture-of-experts for nuanced ranking

## üîß Architecture Components

### 1. Deterministic Pre-Filters (New Addition)
**Purpose**: Remove trials where patient is clearly ineligible BEFORE expensive LLM calls

**Hard Filters**:
- ‚úÖ Age cutoffs (numeric comparison)
- ‚úÖ Gender restrictions (binary filter)
- ‚úÖ Trial status (exclude "Withdrawn", "Completed")
- ‚úÖ Geography (configurable distance threshold)
- ‚úÖ Biomarker hard exclusions (explicit mismatches)

**Benefits**:
- Reduces noise for LLM
- Saves API costs
- Provides transparency
- Prevents embarrassing mismatches in demos

### 2. LLM Scoring Engine (Enhanced)
**Latest Frontier Models** (not just GPT-5):
- GPT-5
- Claude 4.1 Sonnet
- Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Model selection based on availability/performance

### 3. Mixture-of-Experts (New Addition)
**Multiple Specialized Prompts**:
1. **Medical Expert** ‚Üí Clinical eligibility nuances
2. **Biomarker Specialist** ‚Üí Molecular matching expertise
3. **Patient Advocate** ‚Üí Quality of life, practicality
4. **LLM Judge** (Meta-Model) ‚Üí Consolidates and adjudicates

**Implementation**:
- Parallel API calls to different models/prompts
- Each expert provides specialized scoring
- Judge model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) consolidates
- Final score with high confidence

## üìä Enhanced Scoring System

### Hybrid Scoring Breakdown (100 points)

| Category | Deterministic | LLM-Assisted | Total |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| **Eligibility** | 20 pts (age, gender) | 20 pts (nuanced) | 40 pts |
| **Biomarker** | 10 pts (hard exclusions) | 20 pts (relevance) | 30 pts |
| **Clinical** | 0 pts | 20 pts (phase/stage) | 20 pts |
| **Practical** | 5 pts (geography) | 5 pts (feasibility) | 10 pts |

### Transparency Features
Each trial result includes:
```json
"deterministic_filters_applied": {
    "age_ok": true,
    "gender_ok": true,
    "trial_open": true,
    "geography_ok": false,
    "biomarker_exclusions": false
}
```

## üöÄ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Deterministic Foundation
1. Build filter engine with clear rules
2. Log all filter decisions
3. Test with edge cases

### Phase 2: LLM Integration
1. Implement multi-model support
2. Create specialized expert prompts
3. Build parallel processing pipeline

### Phase 3: Mixture-of-Experts
1. Design expert personas
2. Implement judge consolidation
3. Optimize for latency

### Phase 4: Evaluation
1. Synthetic expert labels
2. Stability checks (run twice, measure consistency)
3. Cross-model agreement metrics

## üí° Key Improvements Over Original Plan

| Original | Enhanced Hybrid |
|----------|----------------|
| Single LLM model | Multiple frontier models |
| Pure LLM scoring | Deterministic + LLM hybrid |
| Single prompt | Mixture-of-experts |
| Basic caching | Multi-layer caching |
| Simple scoring | Transparent, auditable scoring |

## üé¨ Demo Advantages

1. **Impressive for Investors**: Shows sophisticated ML/AI approach
2. **Safe from Embarrassment**: Deterministic filters prevent obvious errors
3. **Explainable**: Clear reasoning from multiple experts
4. **State-of-the-Art**: Using latest models demonstrates technical prowess
5. **Scalable Story**: Can explain how to optimize for production

## üìà Evaluation Strategy (Demo-Optimized)

### Quick Wins for Demo
1. **Consistency Check**: Run same patient twice ‚Üí show stable results
2. **Expert Disagreement**: Show how judge resolves conflicts
3. **Transparency**: Display which filters were applied
4. **Explanation Quality**: Natural language reasoning from each expert

### Advanced (If Time Permits)
1. **Synthetic Ground Truth**: Generate expert labels with another LLM
2. **Cross-Model Agreement**: Show consensus across different models
3. **Ablation Study**: Compare hybrid vs pure-LLM performance

## üîë Critical Success Factors

1. **Deterministic filters must be bulletproof** - No false negatives
2. **Expert prompts must be distinct** - Each adds unique value
3. **Judge must be authoritative** - Clear consolidation logic
4. **Latency must be acceptable** - Parallel processing essential
5. **Explanations must be clinical** - Use medical terminology correctly

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Implement deterministic filter engine** (30 min)
2. **Create expert prompt templates** (30 min)
3. **Build mixture-of-experts orchestrator** (45 min)
4. **Implement judge consolidation** (30 min)
5. **Add transparency logging** (15 min)
6. **Create evaluation suite** (30 min)

## üéØ Demo Talking Points

When presenting this system:

1. **"We use a hybrid approach"** - Combines best of rules and AI
2. **"Deterministic safety layer"** - Prevents obvious mismatches
3. **"Multiple expert perspectives"** - Like a tumor board consultation
4. **"Latest frontier models"** - Cutting-edge AI capabilities
5. **"Transparent and auditable"** - Every decision is logged
6. **"Production-ready architecture"** - Built to scale

This hybrid approach is significantly more sophisticated than a simple LLM ranker and will definitely impress in a demo setting!
